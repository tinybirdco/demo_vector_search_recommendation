# Use Case Demo: Build a content recommendation system using vector search

This repository contains code for an example content recommendation system using vector search in Tinybird.

Vector search is a great way to approach content matching and recommendations. You can calculate embeddings based on multi-modal analysis of text, images, and other media, then calculate vector distances between embeddings to recommend matching content.
